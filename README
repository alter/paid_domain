install whois module,
if you need support of .su and .pro zones, use my fork of whois:
pip3 install --upgrade git+https://github.com/alter/python-whois.git

./paid-domain.py3 ag-up.com                                         
244

Now you can set it in zabbix and alert when you need to pay for domain.
